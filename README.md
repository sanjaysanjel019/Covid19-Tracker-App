# Covid19-Tracker-App

This is a COVID-18 Tracker Application created using Simple PHP.


API used for fetching data : https://github.com/pomber/covid19

Pomber API is used because it gives data as JSON format rather than CSV format as provided by John Hopkins University.


Special thanks to PacketCode Youtube channel for his awesome tutorial !! ðŸ’Ž
